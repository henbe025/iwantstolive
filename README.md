## Summary

Wanna travel but do not know where? Do not worry, because AI is here to save your hypothetical trip! 

## Background

After nearly two years of various lockdowns and restrictions on travel, many people probably look forward to tavel somewhere - anywhere - in 2022 and beyond. However, once someone realises just how big the world outside their home is, they will run into the issue of exactly where to travel. Thus, what they will need is somebody - or rather, something - giving them expert recommendations. 


## How is it used?

Essentially, the AI would give recommendations based on preferences. For instance, if one would set their preferences as "short travel, cheap prices, can get by usingÂ [own language]", the AI would recommend places that fulfill those preferences. This would be useful for tons of people who wanna travel somewhere new but do not know where to start looking. 

## Data sources and AI methods

The data should be collected from a various of sources concerning travel. There are countless of online forums and websites deditacted to reviewing travel destinations; by using these sites, one could assign different destinations numerical values (for instance, if many people recommended the place, it would get a higher score) and then, by averaging the score would then be compared to the clients preferences. There should be lots of different variables one could put in (both the destination data and ones personal preferences), but at the same time, not every can be compulsory for the client as it would turn some people off (look at how people do not like to take long surveys compared to shorter ones). However, the more one would type in, the more personalised results one would get. 

## Challenges

Of course, this type of thing can only predict destinations based on assumptions. Thus, just because the predicted destination seems perfect on paper does not mean that reality will be. However, at the same time, one should not blindly follow AI and only see this for what this is; recommendations. Thus, it is no different than asking a friend for advice as their advice does not garantee a successful trip either.
